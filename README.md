# Thalia

**Thalia** is a collection of tools and snippets for building voice assistant and transcription workflows. Inspired by *Thalia*, the AI assistant of rapper Logic. a fictional character who serves as a narrator and guide throughout several of his albums, this project empowers you to create your own audio-aware automation tools â€” from real-time voice commands to smart transcription pipelines.

This project is currently in its very early stages and I do not know yet what I will build into ready to use tools.
